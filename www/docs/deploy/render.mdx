## Modify an Existing tRPC Project for Render

1. Add the YAML below to a `render.yaml` file at the root of your repo.
1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub or GitLab.
1. [Deploy your code to Render](https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=iac). If you havenâ€™t already, connect your GitHub or GitLab account to Render.
1. Render will deploy your code as a web service, create a PostgreSQL instance, and configure the connection between them. Additionally, future pushes to your GitHub or GitLab repo will automatically deploy your Render web service.

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: trpc-nextjs-starter
    env: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: yarn --prod=false &&
      yarn build
    startCommand: yarn start
    healthCheckPath: /api/trpc/healthz
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production

      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: trpc-nextjs-starter-db
          property: connectionString

      - fromGroup: trpc-nextjs-starter

databases:
