# Deploy tRPC on [Render.com](https://render.com)

[tRPC](https://trpc.io) a toolkit that allow you to easily build fully typesafe full-stack applications faster than ever before with support for both web and React Native. tRPC removes the need for GraphQL/REST and clunky API schemas by automatically inferring the backend into your frontend.

## One-Click Deploy

](https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-starter-websockets)

## Modify an Existing tRPC Project for Render

1. Add the YAML below to a `render.yaml` file at the root of your repo.
1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub or GitLab.
1. [Deploy your code to Render](https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=iac). If you havenâ€™t already, connect your GitHub or GitLab account to Render.
1. Render will deploy your code as a web service, create a PostgreSQL instance, and configure the connection between them. Additionally, future pushes to your GitHub or GitLab repo will automatically deploy your Render web service.
